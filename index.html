            <h2>What is InfoSec Unlocked?</h2>
            <p>In 2013, roughly 85% of all Bachelor Degrees of Computer Science were awarded to men and roughly 60% were awarded to caucasians. Known more commonly as the "pipleline problem", this bottleneck drastically affects the representation of women and people of color that will head into Information Security.</p>
            <p>This pipleline isn't the only problem:</p>
            <blockquote style="color: white; line-height: 30px;">"Where you have to say, I'm color-blind or I'm gender-blind or I'm sexual orientation-blind, in order to see people as your colleagues, in order to feel like you're being polite. I want you to see these things as assets." -<i><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/26/426364306/more-than-a-pipeline-problem-in-search-of-diversity-in-silicon-valley?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20150726">Maxine Williams</a>, Director of Diversity, Facebook</i></blockquote>

                <p>We are Information Security Unlocked. Our goal is to connect with the variety of diversity movements that currently exist in the security and hacking communities.</p>
                <p>We provide several services to help diverse infosec professionals collaborate on and propose to speak at infosec conferences, including an ongoing community-maintained calendar of Calls For Proposals for all major infosec conferences and welcoming events. We've hosted several conversations known as DefCon Unlocked with the luminaries of the infosec world from Defcon and beyond to address concerns related to diversity in security.</p>

            <h2>What is InfoSec Unlocked?</h2>
            <p>In 2013, roughly 85% of all Bachelor Degrees of Computer Science were awarded to men and roughly 60% were awarded to caucasians. Known more commonly as the "pipleline problem", this bottleneck drastically affects the representation of women and people of color that will head into Information Security.</p>
            <p>This pipleline isn't the only problem:</p>
            <blockquote style="color: white; line-height: 30px;">"Where you have to say, I'm color-blind or I'm gender-blind or I'm sexual orientation-blind, in order to see people as your colleagues, in order to feel like you're being polite. I want you to see these things as assets." -<i><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/26/426364306/more-than-a-pipeline-problem-in-search-of-diversity-in-silicon-valley?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20150726">Maxine Williams</a>, Director of Diversity, Facebook</i></blockquote>
            <p>ISUnlocked works towards making sure that computer security and hacking conferences are inclusive and welcoming environments.</p>
            <p>This has been our first year of operation and organization. We've hosted several conversations known as DefCon Unlocked with some of the attendees and organizers of DefCon to address concerns related to diversity in information security.</p>

                <p>We are Information Security Unlocked. Our goal is to connect with the variety of diversity movements that currently exist in the security and hacking communities.</p>
                <p>We help those who are underrepresented at conferences to have stronger and clear presence. Our full site (currently under construction) will host information and resources to help everyone submit papers and workshops, become comfortable attending conferences and getting involved.</p>
